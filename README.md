~~1. Fig. 1.~~  
> - IgG staining result will put in supplementary figures.
> - The gating should be elevated and same for both transferred and recipient.
> - In main figures,  IgG gating should be dropped out. 
> 
2.	Fig. 2.
> - CFSE will be removed.
> - IL-4 bar will be added.

3.	Fig. 3.
> - Annexinv
> - Bim (histogram). FasL will be removed.
> - CFSE (CFA model only)

4.	Fig. 4.
> -	In vitro CFSE
> - In vitro glycolysis
> 
5.	Fig. 5. (RNAseq)
> - Venn diagram
> - X-y scatter
> - Change pathway analysis. If the common pathway is same ascross all cell types and shows TCR or apoptosis are the enriched pathways, then put it in main figures.
