# JunB CD4 manucript revision memo

1. Fig. 1. 
> - ~~Drop out CD44 data.~~
> - Make MFI for JunB CD44 hi.
> - manuscript/result.

2. Fig. 2.
> - ~~Arrange the figure horizontally. (B,C,D; E,F,G)~~
> - ~~Delete p value from IL13 chart.~~
> - Pick another KO sample to represent the %IFNG (~30%).
> - manuscript/result.

3. Fig. 3.
> - Overlap WT and KO histogram (Both CFSE and BIM).
> - Bar graphs only show MFI (BIM).
> - ~~Drop out %BIM bar graph.~~
> - manuscript/result.

4. Fig. 4.
> - ~~In vitro cell death.~~
> - manuscript/result.

5. Fig. 5.
> - In vitro CFSE and In vitro sea horse.
> - manuscript/result.

6. Fig. 7. 
> - ~~If pathway analysis can show apoptosis pathway is enriched in all cell types, then keep it.~~
> - manuscript/result.

8. Fig. 6.
> - Th2 is optional.
> - If JunB deletion does not affect IRF4 binding, we should put cut-and-run data to show JunB deletion affects epigenetical structure. 
> - manuscript/result.

1. Fig. 1. 
> - ~~IgG staining result will put in supplementary figures.~~
> - ~~The gating should be elevated and same for both transferred and recipient.~~
> - ~~In main figures,  IgG gating should be dropped out.~~ 
> 
2.	Fig. 2.
> - ~~CFSE will be removed.~~
> - ~~IL-4 bar will be added.~~
> 
3.	Fig. 3.
> - ~~Annexinv~~
> - ~~Bim (histogram). FasL will be removed.~~
> - ~~CFSE (CFA model only)~~
> 
4.	Fig. 4.
> -	In vitro CFSE
> - ~~In vitro glycolysis~~
> 
5.	Fig. 5. (RNAseq)
> - ~~Venn diagram~~
> - ~~X-y scatter~~
> - Change pathway analysis. If the common pathway is same ascross all cell types and shows TCR or apoptosis are the enriched pathways, then put it in main figures.
> 
6.	Fig. 6. (ChIP-PCR)
> - ~~Th1 and Th2 are put in separate bar.~~
> - Confirm the calculation method of % enrichment.
